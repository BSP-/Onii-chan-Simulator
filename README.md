Everyone's Visual Novel
===
A free visual novel engine anyone can use
This project is still under extremely early development, come back later!

What works:
---
* Loading images and audio
* Displaying simple scenes
	* Display characters, backgrounds, dialogue box and dialogue text
* Proper splitting of dialogue lines, overflow is handled as well
* Changing the sprite of a character
* Parsing easy-to-write "eVNML" markup language for writing novels
* Probably more

What needs to be done:
---
* Dialogue selection / choice menus
* Flags
* Loading audio as buffers
* A way to insert sound effects
* Animated dialogue printing (typewriter effect)
* A "view" system so we can draw stuff like menus and scenes seperately (this is a big one)
* Saving/loading system using localStorage
* Animations for moving characters around on-screen
* Fading animations for transitioning anything (backgrounds, sprites etc.)
* Probably more
